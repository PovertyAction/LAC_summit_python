## Jupyter notebooks
<a href="https://jupyter.org/">The Jupyter Notebook</a> is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

Jupyter supports over many programming languages, including Python and R. Notebooks can be shared with others using email, Dropbox, GitHub and the Jupyter Notebook Viewer. Your code can produce rich, interactive output: HTML, images, videos, LaTeX, and custom MIME types.

You can find instructions for installing Jupyter notebook <a href="https://jupyter.org/install">here</a> or in the link provided for installing Python.
