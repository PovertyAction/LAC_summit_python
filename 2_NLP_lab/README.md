### This repository is located at https://github.com/PovertyAction/LAC_summit_python/edit/master/2_NLP_lab.

### Description

This repository contains the files needed for the  Natural Language Processing (NLP) Lab. NLP (Natural Language Processing) is a set of techniques for approaching text problems. In this lab we will go over an example of how to use text data to make predictions using a simple bag of words model. 

We will perform sentiment analysis, to identify and extract subjective information from movie reviews and categorize them inot positive and negative reviews.

*_This exercise is based on this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/overview">kaggle tutorial</a> and modified to fit the objectives of the session._

### Materials in this repository
1) NLP lab session.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with code for the excercise
2) Slides - (ADD NAME) - Presentation slides for session
3) Data - (ADD NAME) - Data to run the code
4) Readme - this file

### Running the Jupyter notebooks during the workshop
You will be running the Python notebooks on a server, so you do not need to install any software. Your username
and password will be provided at the beginning of the session.

### Running the Jupyter notebooks in you computer
To run the Jupyter notebooks on your own machine, clone the repository using git. You will need to install
git, python and Jupyther notebooks before doing this. Below are the required packages to run the code.

### Requirements:
 * numpy
 * pandas
 * bs4 - BeautifulSoup 
 * re 
 * nltk
 * nltk.corpus - stopwords
 * sklearn.feature_extraction.text - CountVectorizer 
 * sklearn.ensemble - RandomForestClassifier 
 * sklearn.model_selection - train_test_split 
 * matplotlib.pyplot - plt
